``SIH 2024``
```Android app``` 
So this project is based on before , during and after disaster management.
I have connected OpenWeather app API and google map api 
so kindly generate your own api key and replace it 
before - Sends alert messages
during - we can ask help from nearby police station
after - shows precaution . Volunteering and donating page 
 

Make sure to replace with your own "API Key" 

I will be deactivating my "API" key shortly .

Run it in Android studio :)
